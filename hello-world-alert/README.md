â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â””â”€â”€ script.js
```

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your branch.

## Hints

- Use the `alert` function in JavaScript to display a message.
- Make sure your JavaScript code is linked correctly in the HTML file.

## Demo

Hereâ€™s a simple example of what your `index.html` and `script.js` files should look like:

**index.html**:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World Alert</title>
    <script src="script.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

**script.js**:
```javascript
window.onload = function() {
    alert('Hello World');
};
```

When you open `index.html` in a web browser, it should display an alert box with the message "Hello World".
